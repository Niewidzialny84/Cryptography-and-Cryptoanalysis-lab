# Cryptography and Cryptanalysis - laboratory

Laboratory course is split into three parts where each one is placed in differnet folder and number. All of the labs and their tasks are described below.

## Lab 1

Analyzis of functions inside sbox.

1. Open file sbox.txt and read the functions in it.
2. Checking balance of each function. How much 0 and 1 are in it.
3. Determining nonlinearity of each function.
4. Veryfing strict avalanche criterien (SAC) for each function.

Created program can be run as every python console aplication using `python3 main.py` command. All steps and results are printed during runtime.

## Lab 2

Differential cryptanalysis of DES S-boxes. Result set of running the program is a set of potential keys, differential distributions tables, SI characteristics and all possible keys.

## Lab 3

Implementation and analysis of hash function. Implemented function was Keccak hash function used in SHA-3.
